- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yi Hu. You can call me Lucas. 
- I am an overseas student from China. Now I am studying for a Master's degree in computer engineering 
at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.

- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in full-stack Web development and am trying to find work in this field. 

About my experience:
- When I was an undergraduate, I was very interested in front-end development and simulated 
the front-end pages of many famous Chinese websites, such as Taobao, Jingdong and Pinduoduo.

- Later, I came to the United States for my master's degree. In my first term, I learnt the course CS7340 "Service Oriented 
Software Engineering", I got exposed to the development of REST APPs. And then I started to learn how to make complete full-stack APPs.
- I have made some of the results of my study public on my Github page, welcome your tests and advices.

- ðŸŒ± At present, I am deepening my learning of Java and javascript, as well as their application.
