ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yi Hu. You can call me Lucas. 
- I am an international student from China. Now I am studying for Master's degree in computer engineering at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, and expected graduate date is Jun 2023.

- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in full-stack Web development and am trying to find work in this field. 

- I have passion for working with software. Utilized the summer and winter holiday,  I have made some extra projects actively and published them on my Github page. Functions in application work perfectly as expected is very existing for me. Welcome to test and give me advice.

- Besides, I enjoy learning new things while solving problems. For example, when I had an error in configuration of environment variables on Mac system, I searched all the ways to configure environment variables on Mac and learned the differences between them, then I used the most effective method to solve my problem. Such new knowledge always impressed me.

- ðŸŒ± At present, I am deepening my learning of Java and javascript, as well as their application.

- If you have any questions or advices, please let me know.
